I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at University of Maryland, College Park, supervised by Prof. Heng Huang. Prior to that, I obtained my M.S. degree in Electrical& Computer Engineering at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2019, and I obtained my B.S. degree in Electronic Engineering at Fudan University in 2017.
